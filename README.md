# Algebra Driven Design with Agda

This repository contains some Agda source code files to clarify my thoughts while reading the book
*Algebra Driven Design*, currently up to Chapter 3. It also allowed me to verify some
[exercise solutions](./src/Add/Tiles/Exercises.agda).

## Requirements

I have been using [Agda 2.6.3](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Agda-2.6.3)
by the time of reading the book, with the
[Agda standard library 1.7.2](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/releases/tag/v1.7.2)
as a dependency.
